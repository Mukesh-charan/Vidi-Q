00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,407
Imagine modeling a system, like a car on

2
00:00:03,507 --> 00:00:07,265
a predictable road. But what happens when an

3
00:00:07,365 --> 00:00:13,052
entirely unexpected variable, say, a 'dinosaur', suddenly appears?

4
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:19,352
In mathematics, we often use linear functions to predict

5
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:23,358
motion. A simple y equals mx plus b describes

6
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:28,166
a constant speed, assuming a smooth, undisturbed path.

7
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:34,637
The 'dinosaur in the road' represents a sudden, non-linear perturbation.

8
00:00:34,737 --> 00:00:39,696
It's a stochastic event, an outlier that defies our initial,

9
00:00:39,796 --> 00:00:44,502
simplified models, forcing us to rethink our assumptions.

10
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:49,106
Consider a point moving along this predicted path.

11
00:00:49,206 --> 00:00:53,341
The 'dinosaur' introduces chaos, forcing the path to

12
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:58,473
deviate, demonstrating the limits of deterministic predictions.

13
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:04,814
So, while models provide structure, remember that real-world

14
00:01:04,914 --> 00:01:09,258
scenarios often hide 'dinosaurs,' reminding us to build

15
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:12,974
flexibility and account for the unpredictable.
