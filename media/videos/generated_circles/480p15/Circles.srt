00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,778
Circles are everywhere, from planets to pizzas! But

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:08,113
how do we describe their perfect symmetry mathematically?

3
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:11,156
Let's discover the equation of a circle.

4
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:17,283
A circle is all points equidistant from its center. We'll

5
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:22,040
use the distance formula: d equals the square root of

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,888
(x2 minus x1) squared plus (y2 minus y1) squared. This

7
00:00:26,988 --> 00:00:32,902
connects directly to the Pythagorean theorem on a coordinate plane.

8
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:40,981
A circle is all points equidistant from a center (h, k). Any point

9
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:47,528
on the circle is (x, y), with a constant distance 'r', the radius.

10
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:55,068
Applying the distance formula, we get: the square root of (x-h) squared plus

11
00:00:55,168 --> 00:01:02,807
(y-k) squared equals r. Squaring both sides reveals the standard equation of a

12
00:01:02,907 --> 00:01:08,561
circle: (x-h) squared plus (y-k) squared equals r squared.

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,398
For a circle at (2, -3) with radius 5: (x-2) squared plus

14
00:01:16,498 --> 00:01:25,837
(y-(-3)) squared equals 5 squared. This simplifies to (x-2) squared plus (y+3)

15
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:32,252
squared equals 25. See how the center and radius fit!

16
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:40,512
So, (x-h) squared plus (y-k) squared equals r squared beautifully

17
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:46,946
defines any circle, connecting its center (h,k) and radius 'r'

18
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:52,342
to its shape. A truly powerful and elegant equation!
