00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,117
Ever wondered how your digital identity or transactions stay

2
00:00:05,217 --> 00:00:10,683
secure online? It's often thanks to cryptographic hash functions

3
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:15,380
like SHA-256, vital for data integrity and blockchain.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,360
At its core, a hash function takes any input and

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,794
produces a fixed-size string, a 'fingerprint'. Cryptographic hashes are special:

6
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:33,228
they're one-way, meaning you can't reverse them, and highly collision-resistant.

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,933
SHA-256, or Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit, transforms any input data

8
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:47,371
into a unique, fixed-length 256-bit hash. This output is typically

9
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:53,809
displayed as a 64-character hexadecimal string. Even a tiny change

10
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:59,369
in the input completely alters the hash â€“ this 'avalanche

11
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:05,222
effect' is key. The vast 2^256 possible outputs make finding

12
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:10,588
two inputs with the same hash astronomically difficult.

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,972
In blockchain, every transaction is hashed, creating an unbreakable

14
00:01:18,072 --> 00:01:24,056
chain. For passwords, systems store your password's SHA-256 hash,

15
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:29,580
never the password itself, significantly boosting security.

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,390
In essence, SHA-256 provides a robust, irreversible digital fingerprint

17
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:43,516
for data, underpinning the security of countless digital systems.
