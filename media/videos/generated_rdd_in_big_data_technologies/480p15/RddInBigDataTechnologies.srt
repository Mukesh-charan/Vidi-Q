00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,919
How do big data systems handle massive datasets efficiently and

2
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:09,620
reliably? The secret often lies in something called an RDD.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,113
Big Data processing needs fault tolerance and parallelization.

4
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:19,100
Traditional data structures struggle with this at scale.

5
00:00:20,266 --> 00:00:24,701
An RDD, or Resilient Distributed Dataset, is a fundamental

6
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:29,626
data structure in frameworks like Apache Spark. Resilient means

7
00:00:29,726 --> 00:00:34,395
it can rebuild lost partitions using its lineage. Distributed

8
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:39,320
means it's spread across many machines for parallel processing.

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,854
And Dataset refers to an immutable collection of elements.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,997
Imagine filtering a huge log file. An RDD lets

11
00:00:49,097 --> 00:00:54,074
you define transformations like 'map' or 'filter' on your

12
00:00:54,174 --> 00:00:58,796
data, which are then executed lazily and in parallel.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,061
RDDs are key to scalable, fault-tolerant Big Data

14
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:09,836
processing, enabling efficient parallel computation across clusters.
