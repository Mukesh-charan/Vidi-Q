[00:00:00] Hello! Today, we're diving into linear regression, a powerful tool for understanding relationships between variables.

[00:00:05] Imagine we have a bunch of data points, like these.  Each dot represents a data point with an x and a y value.  This is called a scatter plot.  We can see a general trend â€“ as x increases, y tends to increase too.

[00:00:15]  Linear regression helps us find the best-fitting straight line through these points.  This line represents the overall trend in our data.  We call this line the line of best fit, or regression line.

[00:00:25] The equation of this line is y = mx + c, where 'm' is the slope (how steep the line is) and 'c' is the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis).

[00:00:40] Linear regression calculates 'm' and 'c' to minimize the overall distance between the line and all the data points.  It finds the line that best summarizes the data.

[00:00:55]  In this case, our regression line has a slope (m) of approximately  [show m value from script] and a y-intercept (c) of approximately [show c value from script].

[00:01:10] Now, what if we want to predict the y value for a new x value, say x = 7? We simply use the equation of our regression line: y = mx + c. Substitute x=7, and we get a predicted y value of approximately [show predicted y value from script].

[00:01:30] So, linear regression not only helps us understand the relationship between variables but also allows us to make predictions based on that relationship.  That's the power of linear regression!
